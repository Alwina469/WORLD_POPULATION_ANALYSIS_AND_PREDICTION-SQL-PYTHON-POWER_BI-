##  INTRODUCTION

This project is a comprehensive analysis of global population trends using SQL, Python (Jupyter Notebook), and Power BI. 

The study focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using MySQL.

The final visualizations are presented in Power BI to provide a clear and interactive representation of key population insights.

The **primary objective** is to analyze historical population data, understand demographic shifts, identify key growth patterns, and predict future population figures for the years 2030 and 2040. 

The project also evaluates the **prediction model** by testing it against historical population data.

##  PROJECT OVERVIEW

  The project follows a structured workflow:

 ### Step 1: Data Cleaning (SQL)

- Raw population data was cleaned using SQL.

- Handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and standardized data formats.


 ### Step 2: Feature Engineering (SQL)

- Created additional features such as population density, growth rates, and percentage changes over decades.

- Extracted key insights like the most populous countries, fastest-growing nations, and continent-wide trends.


### Step 3: Predictive Modeling (SQL)

- Developed a basic population prediction model using MySQL .

- Forecasted global population figures for 2030 and 2040.

- Validated the model by comparing its predictions against past population data.


### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Jupyter Notebook)

- Performed in-depth statistical analysis on global population trends.

- Identified the fastest-growing and slowest-growing countries.

- Analyzed population density vs. land area.

- Evaluated the contribution of each country to global population.


### Step 5: Data Visualization (Power BI)

- Created an interactive dashboard to present key insights.

- Incorporated slicers for continent-wise and country-wise analysis.

## INSIGHTS FROM POWER BI DASHBOARD

The Power BI dashboard visualizes key population trends, including:

- **Global Population Growth** : The world's population has seen exponential growth from 1970 to 2022.

- **Top 10 Most Populous Countries (2022)**: China, India, and the US are leading in population size.

- **Population Growth by Continent**: Asia remains the most populous continent, followed by Africa, which has the highest growth rate.

- **Population Density vs. Area Size**: Small regions like Macau and Monaco have extremely high population densities.

- **Fastest Growing Countries**: Countries such as Moldova, Poland, and Niger show rapid growth rates.

- **Population Trends by Decade**: Certain regions, such as the Middle East, have experienced significant population booms.

## KEY RESULTS AND INSIGHTS FROM EDA

### Global Population Growth Trends

- The global population increased from 3.69 billion (1970) to 7.97 billion (2022).

- Rapid growth was observed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.


### Top 10 Most Populous Countries (2022)

- China and India together contribute to over 35% of the world’s population.

- The United States is the third most populous nation but has a much lower growth rate.


### Population Growth by Continent

- Africa has the highest growth rate (1.02x per year), indicating future economic and infrastructural challenges.

- Asia, the most populous continent, has a moderate growth rate (1.009x per year).

- Europe has the slowest growth rate, with some countries experiencing population decline.


### Population Density vs. Area

- Macau (3,023,172 per sq. km) and Monaco (218,234 per sq. km) are the most densely populated regions.

- Greenland, the Falkland Islands, and Western Sahara have the lowest population densities.


### Fastest Growing Countries

- Moldova, Poland, and Niger are experiencing the highest growth rates.

- African and Middle Eastern nations dominate the list of rapidly growing populations.


### Population Percent Change (1970–2022)

- United Arab Emirates (UAE) grew by 3,067%, the highest recorded growth.

- Qatar and Mayotte also experienced extreme growth.


### Countries Contributing the Most to Global Population

- China (17.88%) and India (17.77%) account for more than one-third of the world's population.

- The US contributes only 4.24%, despite being the third most populous country.


### Prediction Model Results

- The model predicts a global population increase in 2030 and 2040.

- Africa and Asia will continue to experience the highest growth rates.

- Europe's population will remain nearly stagnant, with some declines.
